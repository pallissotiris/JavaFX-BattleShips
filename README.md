# JavaFX-BattleShips
This project was made for a uni project and is pretty cool!

It was made using Java SDK 15 and JAVAFX 15. The idea is that the player picks a scenario via the menu Application>Load. 
The scenarios are in the "medialab" folder and they consist of 5 lines in the format: ship_id,row,column,orientation  .
Some examples already exist! After loading succesfully, the player starts the game via the menu Application>Start.
After that, the user inputs the coordinates they want to shoot in the form in the bottom and press the "Shoot!" button.
Game ends when all ships are down or when both players have taken 40 shots. Have fun!

Feel free message me for any questions!
